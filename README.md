# React Frontend App for Summer Practice 2025 @ Haufe

This is the boilerplate for our final frontend app.

There will be 4 teams, for 4 widgets. Each of you(as a team) will implement the widget according to the requirements below:

### Team 1 ‚Äì Current Weather Overview

- Show current temperature and a weather emoji (‚òÄÔ∏è, üåßÔ∏è, ‚ùÑÔ∏è).
- Show basic info: wind speed or feels-like temperature (optional).
- Keep styling simple (1 card, text + emoji).

### Team 2 ‚Äì 3-Day Forecast Chart

- Display a small chart or list of temperature highs/lows for the next 3 days.
- No need for fancy animations, just text or a simple bar chart.

### Team 3 - Hourly Weather Timeline

- Show next 6‚Äì12 hours of weather in a list or horizontal scroll.
- Each entry: time + emoji + temperature.
- Keep UI simple (no extra libraries required).

### Team 4 ‚Äì City Info

- Show selected city info: country, latitude, longitude.
- Optional: country flag emoji.
- Focus on layout and using data from context, not fetching extra APIs.

Happy coding!
